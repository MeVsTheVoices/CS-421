This is for 2235-CS-421-01-2452-1 at CSUEB during the Spring '23 semester

Project 2 is a very basic shell that supports
                Switching between jobs
                Foreground/Background
                Terminating
                Listing jobs


Project 3 simulates
		Shortest Job First
		First Come First Serve
		Round Robin
	As scheduling algorithms, then displays their relative statistics
	And a nice gant chart to display the sequence and times of execution
